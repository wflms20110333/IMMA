		As college students, we've struggled to manage our browsing habits. And in quarantine, we've felt more isolated than ever. But even in these times, there are still idols and heroes that we value and look up to, who somehow make our fights and struggles feel a little less lonely.</p>
	
	<p class="w3-large">
		So, we were inspired to create Browserbug: we hope that it brings a spark of life to your online work.</p>

	<p class="w3-large">
		We'd love to hear your [suggestions] to improve!
		We depend on donations and premium feature purchases to support our project. If Browserbug has helped you, please help us spread the word! And feel free to buy us some ko-fi so we can continue developing Browserbug to become better and better :)</p>
