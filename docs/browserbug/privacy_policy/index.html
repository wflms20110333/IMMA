        <h2>Browserbug Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: August 12, 2020</p>
        <p>Hi there! Kudos to you for being privacy-conscious :) We've tried our best to make our Privacy Policy readable by the average human, but if you have any questions or concerns, send us an <a href="mailto:support@imma.studio">email</a>!</p>
        <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>If you choose to upload your own image when you create a Browserbug, please be aware that we're hosting images on our server. The image stored at the URL generated is publicly visible, not only to our extension functions but also to anyone with the image link.</p>
        <p>If you choose to upload your Browserbug to our server, that file (including custom messages and other involved content) will also be stored on our server. As with images, this content is visible to anyone who has access to the generated Browserbug link.</p>
        <p>Site tracking: This is an optional feature; users can choose to enable site tracking in Options. If enabled, Browserbug will occasionally check the current websites you're on and use your list of flagged sites ("flagged sites" are what you manually input through user options) to send relevant messages. Site tracking computation is done locally on your device. This information is not sent to our server, so we (as developers/managers of Browserbug) don't have access to any of your site tracking information. Even locally, we don't store a history of which sites you've visited in the past.</p>
        <p>Other information that you volunteer to us, including (but not limited to!) bug reports, feature suggestions, and communication through social media, email, and other means, is fully visible to us and is considered as content you provide to us.</p>
        <p>Remember that <b>all</b> content submission is dictated by our Terms of Use! Please note that we may personally access content that you upload to check if it violates our Terms of Use - our Terms of Use has more legal details.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we'd like to emphasize that we don't share or sell any user information. We profit through users' purchases of premium features and donations. Please donate so that we can continue to run Browserbug! :)</p>
        <h3>Advertisements</h3>
        <p>While currently advertisements are unimplemented, in the future, we plan to use Google AdSense to run (hopefully) unobtrusive advertisements. As a heads up, here's how that would work privacy-wise:</p>
        <p><i>Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a Google partner's website, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.</i></p>
        <p><i>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>.</i></p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We've done our best to make Browserbug secure, but the world is a dangerous business. So here's our disclaimer that we can't guarantee 100% security. :( Please help report security problems to us by <a href="mailto:support@imma.studio">email</a>!</p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time! Your usage of Browserbug after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page constitutes your acknowledgment of and agreement to the new policy. Upon any major updates to this policy (i.e. not typos), we'll do our best to send out notices to our social media accounts and also to your Browserbug mailbox (top left corner of your popup).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wow! Extra kudos to you for finishing the whole thing- such a fast reader! Let us know if you have any questions <a href="mailto:support@imma.studio">here</a>.</p>
