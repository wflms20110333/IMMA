        <h2>Browserbug Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: July 17, 2020</p>
        <p>Hi there! Kudos to you for being privacy-conscious :) We've tried our best to make our Privacy Policy readable by the average human, but if you have any questions or concerns, send us an <a href="mailto:support@imma.studio">email</a>!</p>
        <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>If you choose to use your own image when you create a Browserbug, please be aware that we're hosting images on our server so that our notifications have a reliable source for the image. If you choose to upload your Browserbug, that file will also be stored on our server. Images and other content that you upload are potentially visible to us and to anyone who has access to an image link or to a Browserbug link.</p>
        <p>Users can enable site tracking in options. If enabled, Browserbug just occasionally checks the websites you're on and uses your list of flagged sites ("flagged sites" are what you manually input through user options) to refine your current scores for mood and productivity. These scores are what get periodically passed on to our server, along with your current Browserbug's message bank; we then run algorithms to pick the best message for you. We can't derive your browser history from your scores, and we don't store a history of which sites you've visited in the past, even locally.</p>
        <p>Other information that you volunteer to us, including (but not limited to!) bug reports, feature suggestions, and email communication, is fully visible to us. Remember that all content submission is dictated by our Terms of Use!</p>
        <p>We analyze overall trends in server interactions to improve our extension, and to guard against the server from getting overloaded (and us consequently going broke), but we won't analyze data to learn about individual users unless we are specially requested to.</p>
        <p>We don't share or sell any user information. We profit through users' purchases of premium features, donations, and advertisements.</p>
        <h3>Advertisements</h3>
        <p>We use Google AdSense to run (hopefully) unobtrusive advertisements; here's how that works privacy-wise:</p>
        <p><i>Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a Google partner's website, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.</i></p>
        <p><i>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>.</i></p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We've done our best to make Browserbug secure, but the world is a dangerous business. So here's our disclaimer that we can't guarantee 100% security :( Please help report security problems to us by <a href="mailto:support@imma.studio">email</a>!</p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time! Your usage of Browserbug after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page constitutes your acknowledgment of and agreement to the new policy. Upon any major updates to this policy (i.e. not typos), we'll do our best to send out notices to our social media accounts and also to your Browserbug mailbox (top left corner of your popup).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wow! Extra kudos to you for finishing the whole thing- such a fast reader! Let us know if you have any questions <a href="mailto:support@imma.studio">here</a>.</p>
