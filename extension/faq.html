            <p class="question">Not receiving messages?</p>
            <p class="answer">Check that your device isn't set to "do not disturb," "focus assist," or otherwise blocking notifications.</p>

            <p class="question">My messages stay on my screen for too long / my messages fade too quickly.</p>
            <p class="answer">Notification duration is controlled by your operating system. For example, in Windows 10, you can control this in <i>Ease of Access > Display > Show notifications for...</i>. You can also disable notification fading through the <a href="options.html">Options</a> page.</a></p>
