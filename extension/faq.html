            <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
            
            <p class="question">I'm concerned about my privacy!</p>
            <p class="answer">We wouldn't want our browsing histories to be viewed or shared or sold, and we promise to treat you with that same respect.</p>
            <p class="answer">Your extension can see which sites you're visiting, but all that information is processed locally on your computer. From our side, we can't see which sites you've visited.</p>
            <p class="answer">We minimize the information visible to us whenever possible. But no need to just take our word for it: we've written up the details in our <a href="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a> if you'd like to read more!</p>
            
            <p class="question">Can I change how long messages stay on my screen?</p>
            <p class="answer">Sure! Notification duration is controlled by your operating system. For example, on Windows 10, you can control this in <i>Ease of Access > <a href="ms-settings:easeofaccess-display">Display</a> > Show notifications for</i>. On a Mac, [[who knows?]]</p>

            <p class="question">Can I customize my message layout?</p>
            <p class="answer">Not yet! But if you'd be interested in setting a custom background color for your notifications, including GIFs or video, or doing other cool stuff, please help support us [[[here]]] so we can develop a desktop version of Browserbug!</p>

            <p class="question">Can I mute the sound of my notifications?</p>
            <p class="answer">We're working on this! It's not much, but if you need to, you can mute all Chrome notifications in <i>System > <a href="ms-settings:notifications">Notifications & Actions</a> > Google Chrome</i>.</p>

            <p class="question">Other questions?</p>
            <p class="answer">Shoot us an <a href="mailto:browserbug@imma.studio">email</a> or <a href="https://forms.gle/M1YS2Ch1Ku2BFHWb8" target="_blank">feedback form</a>!</p>

            <h3>TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>

            <p class="question">I don't see the Browserbug icon in my extensions bar?</p>
            <p class="answer">Click the puzzle piece icon or see if Browserbug might be hidden or minimized!</p>

            <p class="question">I'm not receiving my messages!</p>
            <p class="answer">This is the most common issue users have! Don't panic: you can fix this in just a few seconds.</p>
            <p class="answer"><b>For Windows 10 users:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Is Focus Assist turned on?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open the Action Center to check! (Windows logo key + A)</li>
                        <li>Focus Assist will sometimes block notifications: if you want to use Browserbug during Focus Assist, you should add Google Chrome to your <a href="ms-settings:quiethours">priority list</a></i>.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li><b>Are your messages being kept in the Action Center?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open the Action Center to check! (Windows logo key + A)</li>
                        <li>If your notifications are being saved to the Action Center instead of being shown on screen, you can disable this. Open <i>System > <a href="ms-settings:notifications">Notifications & Actions</a> > Google Chrome</i> and uncheck "Show notification in action center."</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li><b>Are notifications turned on?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open <i>System > <a href="ms-settings:notifications">Notifications & Actions</a></i></li>
                        <li>To receive messages, notifications should be allowed, and Google Chrome notifications should be allowed.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li><b>Is Chrome "quieter messaging" turned on?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open <i>Notifications</i> at <i>chrome://settings/content/notifications</i></li>
                        <li>Try turning off quieter messaging.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li>To test if messages are now working, you can increase message frequency in <a href="options.html">Options</a>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="answer">If you haven't received a message in a while, opening the popup menu (click icon in extensions bar) will check for and replace any missed message timers.</p>
