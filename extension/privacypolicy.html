        <h2>Browserbug Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: July 17, 2020</p>
        <p>Hi there! Kudos to you for being privacy-conscious :) We've tried our best to make our Privacy Policy readable by the average human, but if you have any questions or concerns, send us an <a href="mailto:imma.studio.dev@gmail.com">email</a>!</p>
        <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>Browserbug does perform site tracking, but to be more accurate, Browserbug just occasionally checks the websites you're on. Then, still locally on your computer, it compares those sites to your list of flagged sites ("flagged sites" are what you manually input through user options) to calculate a numeric score for you. We can't derive your browser history from the score. We don't store a record of which sites you've visited in the past, even locally. The score is what gets passed on to our server, along with your current Browserbug's message bank: we then run matching algorithms to pick the best message from your custom bank and/or from our own hand-graded general message bank. Note that we don't keep a record of these scores! (Why would we?)</p>
        <p>In addition, when you create a Browserbug, be aware that we're hosting images on our server so our notifications have a reliable source for the image. If you choose to upload your Browserbug, that will also (obviously) be on our server. These images and files are technically visible to us, and to the public, if somebody randomly guesses the link (!) or if you share those links with others.</p>
        <p>We might analyze overall trends in server interactions to improve our extension, and to guard against the server from getting overloaded (and us consequently going broke), but we won't analyze data to learn about individual users, unless you specially request us to through a bug report. Speaking of which, if you'd like to help keep us from being broke, feel free to send a [[ko-fi]] ;)</p>
        <p>We don't share or sell any user information. We profit through users' purchases of premium features, and through donations. If we ever include advertisements, we won't share or sell your information (not that we really have any...) to those third parties.</p>
        <h3>Voluntary information</h3>
        <p>Other information that you volunteer to us, including (but not limited to!) bug reports, feature suggestions, and email communication, is (of course) fully visible to us. Remember that this content submission is dictated by our Terms of Use!</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We've done our best to make Browserbug secure, but the world is a dangerous business, Frodo. So here's our disclaimer that we can't guarantee 100% security :( Please help report security problems to us by <a href="mailto:imma.studio.dev@gmail.com">email</a>!</p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. To get email notifications about these changes in advance, please subscribe to our mailing list, which we have not created yet; please remind us to. We won't share, sell, or otherwise misuse your email address beyond sending Browserbug-related notifications. (That would be ironic...) Your usage of Browserbug after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page constitutes your acknowledgment of and agreement to the new policy. Upon any major updates to this policy (i.e. not typos), we'll also send a notification to your Browserbug mailbox (upper right corner of the popup menu!) visible for the next 7 days.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wow! Extra kudos to you for finishing the whole thing- such a fast reader!</p>
