        <h2>Browserbug Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: July 10, 2020</p>
        <p>Hi there! Kudos to you for being privacy-conscious :) We've tried our best to make our Privacy Policy readable by the average human, but if you have any questions or concerns, let us know at [[email here!!!]].</p>
        <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>Browserbug does perform site tracking, but more accurately, Browserbug periodically captures the set of websites you are currently accessing. This list of websites is processed locally: we compare this list of sites to your list of flagged sites ("flagged sites" are what you manually input through user options) to calculate a numeric progress-score for you. This progress-score is what gets passed on to our server. We can't see and can't derive your browser history from this score. Also, we don't store a record of which sites you've visited in the past, even locally.</p>
        <p>In addition to sending your progress-score to the server, we also send a relevant, non-identifiable subset of your user preferences and of your active Browserbug character's information. This is so we can run the computation necessary to choose a sensical message for your Browserbug.</p>
        <p>Other aspects of Browserbug also involve server interaction: for example, image uploading. If you upload an image to use as your Browserbug avatar, we host it on our server and could theoretically access this image ourselves.</p>
        <p>However, we don't record, analyze, or otherwise use any server interactions, unless explicitly ordered to by a DMCA complaint or other process of law. In such an event, we'll notify all affected users (unless we are also explicitly prohibited from doing this).</p>
        <p>We don't share or sell any user information. We profit through users' purchases of premium features, and through donations. If we ever include advertisements, we won't share or sell your information to those third parties.</p>
        <h3>Voluntary information</h3>
        <p>Information that you voluntarily provide us, including but not limited to bug reports, feature suggestions, and email communication, is of course fully visible to us. Any voluntary content submission is dictated by our Terms of Use: please know that we reserve the right to use this received information in any way we see fit.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We've done our best to make Browserbug secure, but we'll never be able to guarantee 100% security. Please help report security problems to us at [[]].</p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. To get email notifications about these changes in advance, please subscribe to our mailing list at [[]]. We won't share, sell, or otherwise misuse your email address beyond sending Browserbug-related notifications. Your usage of Browserbug after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page constitutes your acknowledgment of and agreement to the new policy.</p>
