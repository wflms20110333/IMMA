        <h3>How to Use</h3>
        <p>We've already loaded a default Browserbee character for you to use! By now, you should have already received a notification from it. (If not, check out our Troubleshooting [link] section!)</p>
        <p>[img showing location of studio] When you're ready, feel free to visit the Browserbug Studio and start designing your own character!</p>
    </div>

        <p>For more advanced settings -- want to adjust how often you get messages? -- visit the Options page.</p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>Given that Browserbug performs site tracking and is artificial intelligence (of a sort), privacy is one of the first concerns that many of our users have! Feel free to check out our Privacy Policy [link] or its summarized version [link].</p>
