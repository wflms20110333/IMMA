Whether you'd like your favorite music idol to send you a message of encouragement, a video game character to remind you to take a break, or an old friend to give you a pep talk, Browserbugs make your time online a more productive, more positive, and less lonely experience.

Create your own Browserbug from any image, name them, choose their personality, and even add your own list of custom messages!

--- This is the beta version of Browserbug! Please be patient with us as we continue improving and developing our project :) ---

NEW FEATURES:
- Choose your Browserbug's texting style! Change their tendencies of punctuation (?!?!?!), CAPITALIZATION, or even how often they use emojis :3 XD
- Generate URLs to easily export and share Browserbugs with others! Please remember to also save local copies of Browserbugs you make as we continue developing this feature!
